// consider naming this article "Sex, Seduction and Relationships"

(Girls, please don't murder me for writing this blogpost. Look at all the bright side of what I am conveying and you might end up feeling gratified towards me. )

A hot monday afternoon. I was sitting in a boring compilers lecture trying to listen to the yakking of the old professor who might himself be as old as the first pascal compiler he was talking about (who knows maybe even older). 

Barely 10 minutes into the lecture and my mind and then my eyes began to wander. (So much for the beginning of semester resolve to concentrate on classes. But then it's not my fault. I try my best it's just that the professors don't want <the students to pay attention>). 

From somewhere nearby I heard a <adj> chuckle. Although I was no longer listening to < what the professor was now talking about>, I knew it wouldn't be aything amusing. Scaning through the class to find out who this <adj> person who could be so delighted even while sitting in a monotonous leccture, my eyes stopped on the guy sitting two seats away to my right.  

<Describe his postre - stooping/slouched, add something humorous ... he looked like he might be "tingling" himself>. I realized he was texting (and hopefully not sexting in the class!). 

Ensuring that the professor was not looking in my direction, I whispered over to him - "Still talking with Richa?". 

He looked in my direction with a questioning look on his face as if the name 'Richa' didn't register in his brain. It had been few months since I had last talked with him but as far as I could recall (and I have a farely good memory) he was in a relationship with a girl named 'Richa' when we had last had a conversation.

He <recognized> the blank look on my face and asserted - "Dude, Richa has been long gone. I am with Simran now."

I said inside my head - "Long gone? But you had just got into a relationship with her when we last talked and that was not more than 3 months ago". Suddenly remembering the reputation of the guy I asked, "So what number are you now on, 16?". "Actually, it's 19 now." he said with a coolness that he might very well have been talking about <what> and not the number of relationships he has been in, and returned back to his texting.

The guy sitting between us who had certainly now lost interest in the lecture and was more interested in the conversation going around him wondered out loud to me - "I don't know what the girls see in him and even more how can they fall for some <adj> guy like that."

I myself had wondered that thing after each of my intermittent encounters with him but had never bothered to investigate. However today, things were different. 

I don't know if it was the fact that I didn't have much work planned for the day, or the humdrum lecture, or the lecture hall Wi-Fi which normally rivals the speed of 2G was today, surprisingly, giving good speed. I decided to "research" on what made guys life my aforementioned classmates, or any Don Juan figure for that matter, so sucessful in seducing the opposite gender. My "research" which was supposed to be brief and end with the lecture, ended up keeping me occupied for days to follow and made me go through a diverse variety of literature, blogs, and movies, and devote hours to talking with this <?> classmate of mine.

<-- about Rakes and Pickup Artists -->

<-- conclusion - not every can be or needs to be a rake however there certainly are things about the female sex and relationship dynamics that we can learn from the rake. eg unless you want to soon break-up with your girlfriend and intend to give indications of disinterest, show some active interest the next time she takes you shopping and flatter her whenever she asks if she looks gorgeous ;) -->
