"I have an idea to build synthetic trees to reduce global warming and oxygenate our degrading environment.", says my brother.

(An extremely juvenille blogpost where I lament as old childhood dreams transform into a lifelong fantasy as I grow older.Yet again an acknowledgment goes to my brother Ishan who although didn't help me directly with the content but pushed me - with his constant  stream of "new" ideas - into the mind frame required for writing the post.)

When you are close to completing your graduation and have spent more than 3 years paying more attention on 'HOW' to do things, giving little thought to 'WHAT' to do and negligible thought to 'WHY', it can be a blessing (and simultaneously mind turbulating) to have a (~ 4-7 years) younger brother/sister akin to your old self - one who constantly reminds you of 'WHAT' you wished to do years ago that you have possibly lost sight of while laboriously working on the 'HOW' to do it.

I consider myself fortunate to have a younger brother so alike my former self (though more mischievious and troublesome - our generation were certainly better as kids or atleast I was a better kid! :D ). While his ideas on world betterment, "new" inventions, and "revolutionary" enterprises are palpably ludicrous and one's that can be dismissed with not so much as the effort of Googling and opening the first weblink, they act as a constant reminder of my old dreams and rejuventate the visionary in me.

As I am typing this I lean back on my chair, take a deep breath and look at my 'post-exam, packing my trunk and about to leave for home in few hours' room with glazed eyes. Probably it is the sunset yellow light pouring in from the window that reminds me of the 'harry potter, chamber of secrets, "but I can show you" diary scene' or it is just the conversation I had with my brother an hour ago (this time he was upbeat with "his new idea" on artificially intelligent personal home assistants, which I coldly disregarded, premising my dismissal on the idea being far from new, several tech colossus already working on the idea and the fundamental technological difficulties that make it currently impractical) that makes me reminiscent of an old conversation I had with my school teacher.

  **my (encouraging) teacher** : You are quite bright a student, I am curious to know what do you aspire to do in life?

  **me** : I want to build a very intelligent A.I. operating system. One that can adapt according to its user and respond to the user's thoughts. One that could be a friend, advisor, and personal assistant at the same time. One that can be integrated into our future smart home computing system, security system, our offices, cars and everywhere else we can be.

  **The teacher gives me that patronizing smile**, one that I now give to my brother, **and asks** : That sounds marvelous. How do you plan on making this vision a reality ?

  **me (beaming smugly)** : I plan on getting admission in good engineering college. My dad tells me IITs are the best in India. There I will study computer science, artificial intelligence, and whatever else will be required and then use the acquired knowledge to make my A.I. agent.

  **my teacher (I now wonder how she was managed to control her laughter)** : That sounds like a plan. Good luck!.

I sly smile comes across my face as I remembered that lost, innocent childhood.

Now, don't laugh at me. I had watched Iron Man movie (I) few days back and the geek-cum-dreamer in me was supposed to be entranced by [JARVIS](http://ironman.wikia.com/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.).

I recall having an obverse conversation with one of my classmates few days back. It was a long, involved discussion on convolutional neural nets, deep learning, and other machine learning stuff. 

The (lacklustre) reasons for us troubling our exam prep exhausted brains - 1. The upcoming machine learning (ML) viva and, 2. The topics are in hype in the trendy data science community and their knowledge necessary to crack any data analyst interview.

Don't fret, I won't trouble my long-suffering reader with the ML blather. :P

The years between junior high school and end of college are years of a myriad of changes - we experience a change of personality, change in perception, change in life goals, a complete change in ourselves. While most of these changes are essential to make a transition into independent adults, we and our society could (presumably) be better off without some others. 

The biggest, inadvertent, change we might (do?) experience is a loss of dreams.

As kids, we dream of living and creating a fantasy, utopian world having wonders such as intelligent robots, flying cars, virtual reality games, space travel (maybe even time travel), teleportation, super human abilities (think x-men). A world free from diseases, global warming, pollution, and other environmental problems. A world free from greed, hunger, (personal/physical/political/social/cultural)boundaries, politics and religion - a place where everyone lives in peace and harmony. A united society where people work together towards making the world a better place and people are not caught up in fulfilling their cynical objectives.

With the advent of youth, the allurement of a hedonistic life accompanied with gross bank balances, private jets, and humangous mansions becomes overpowering and the yearning to fill in the void created by a lost childhood zest lets the enticement sneak in unopposed. Oh and by-the-way the life couse marked solely by materialistic ambitions isn't erroneous afterall it is backed by strong social proof (sarcasm intended).

The voice of the dreamer inside us is further squelched with the added responsibilities as we progress further through the ardous journey that we call "life" and gets lost in the clamor of daily chores.

Eventually, mediocity and the feeling of "the world is too big and challenging for us to be someone or do something significant " dawns in and our dreams turn into mediocre aspirations of good enough jobs and comfortable enough lives (don't miss the 'enough' indicating lost enthusiasm and shrunken ambition).

Formal education is imperative however our current education system is inadequate when it comes to helping people nurture a vision of their own. It teaches us how to convert our vision into a reality (It has taught me AI algorithms, data science, operating systems, etc) but I question the percentage of us left with dreams to build on completing our formal education.

Some of us (the "lost" dreamers ?) manage to not lose sight of the dreams they wished to build when young but alas, these are the same people who are uninfluenced by *cruddy* drivers such as grades, and job. Unable to relate the process ('HOW') to their vision ('WHAT'), they often fall behind in our regimented system and fail to acquire the requisite skillset. (Advise to such co-dreamers : trust the process!)

Opposed to the visionaries, are the pragmatic people. Driven by short-term goals, fear and peer competition they become experts in their domain but alas the lack of vision leaves them vying for limited resources over conflicting goals. The close competition eventually wears them out and being coerced into a lackadaisical life in a dead-end career becomes inevitable.

I can sense some scorching readers thinking "itni hi dikkt h to tu khud hi koi trika btade is samasya se bachne ka" {if you have so much problem why don't you yourself come up with some solution}. (Note the 'khud hi' {yourself}). (Unfortunately) Like all problems I ponder about (and have either written or plan to write an idiosyncratic blogpost about), this too requires a cultural shift. It is not a problem of a single individual or a small group of invdividuals can solve. It requires a change in our belief system, a change in our attitudes, a change in our everyday conversations and a change in our what we value in life.

Yeah, yeah all that sounds like something worthwhile but dude, everyone need to earn a living. Yes, we need money to live a comfortable and promising life however, we need to [transform our relationship with money](https://ymoyl.wordpress.com/summary-of-your-money-or-your-life/). We need to get away from our consumerist culture. Rather than viewing money as an endproduct or a way to achieve respectable societal status and to acquire ostentatious material possessions, we need to view money for what it is - a tool to lead a happy, comfortable, and fulfilling life that can be put to use to build our dreams. 

(I will advice you to read the book ["Your Money or Your Life"](https://ymoyl.wordpress.com/summary-of-your-money-or-your-life/) and the concepts of 'Financial Intelligence', 'Financial Integrity', and 'Financial Independence' *might* change your perception of money.) 

My longing for that lost innocent childhood filled with endless dreams and possibilities has started to sweep in but I might better take some mercy now on my forbearing reader who didn't press (Cntrl + w) while reading through the paragraphs of this rather juvenille post. I too should force myself out of this childhood nostalgia and focus on preparing for the upcoming internship afterall I do look forward to getting a PPO (Pre-Placement-Offer) out of it and accha high-paying job nhi hoga toh kaam kese chalega.

Peace out.
