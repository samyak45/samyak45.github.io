<!-- Have you watched the TED Talk by Jon Ronson on [“How one tweet can ruin your life”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAIP6fI0NAI) ? If you haven’t, watch it sometime when you are not busy aimlessly scrolling down monotonous Facebook news feed. 

In a jaw-dropping story of how one un-funny tweet ruined a woman's life and career, Ronson shows how online commenters can end up behaving like a baying mob — and says it's time to rethink how we interact online. 

It got me thinking I can do a Ted Talk on “How one chat can change your life” (and I realized one needs to be invited to give a Ted Talk, and I don’t have an invite).

Anyway, till I get an invite to do a TED talk, here follows a lesser known yet similar incident when social shaming spiralled out of control.

Main charaters :

  + **chalenge_lene_wala** (a guy with ludicrous tendency to accept challenges and one struggling to gain social acceptance)

  + **chalenge_dene_wala** (a conceited old "friend" of **chalenge_lene_wala**)

  + **the_bandi** ("a" self-seeking girl in a iit, aspiring to become "the" girl in the iit)

  + **bandi_ka_banda** (**the_bandi**'s boyfriend)

  + **not_so_righteous_acquaintance** (a mutual acquaintance who proclaims righteousness but proves otherwise)

  + **the_saviour** (**chalenge_lene_wala**'s close friend)

(I don't believe in revenge but I do believe in honest expression. And above all, I believe everyone deserves a right to say.)

Another sleepless night and like most nights these days, my nostalgic brain is running through all the memories I have made during the course of last three and a half years in college. Browsing through all the diverse memories, my mind gets stuck on the memory of a girl, correction the girl, who in pursuit of some fame and in an attempt to feed her pretentious nature, altered my life drastically. Or should I say, almost ended my life tragically.

Social acceptance is a weird inordinate dezire innate to all beings. With its users constanly seeking more likes, more comments, more shares ,social media only highlights this fact. What we often fail to notice in this never ending race to be the most "liked" person, are the repercussions our actions (posts/ shares/ comments) might have on others. And these unthoughtful actions can cut deep, very very deep, when the sword falls on an "innocent" soul.

What is meant by 'innocent' is questionable. Is the overlycompetitive individual who sends a random stranger some flirtatious messages (that too ones found by Googling) to refute friends' accusations, innocent? Is the lonely eccentric person looking for someone to laugh with and tries playing a prank on you, innocent? Probably not. But who are you to decide?

It's a complex world we live in. A world shaped by social networks. A world where everyone has become a jury. 

The feeling of passing our verdict (in the form of comments and private messages), based on a 30 second read of some post, is so elating. The immense satisfaction we get when we prove someone as wrong invigorates our self-righteousness. The instant gratification of stamping on another person, putting whatever non-socially acceptable labels we can think of and and continue scrolling down our news feed. I find relief in knowing that our actual courts still aren't that fasttrack.

"People judge you." - The de-factoness of this assertion strikes you when the judgement of some inadvertent mistake comes howling back to you from all corners, leaving you aghast. 

Though, I must claim that this assertion is wrong. It is wrong not because it is not true but because it is incomplete. A more coherent statement would be - 

> "People judge you and their judgements are shallow. But these shallow judgements can leave even the deepest parts of your soul quivering."

The people around us, even our closest friends, are mysterious to us. Their characters have unfathomable secret recesses that they never reveal. This unknowableness of other people is disturbing to us. So, we prefer to ignore this fact, and judge people on their appearances, on what is most visible to us - words, actions, gestures, looks. And these fleeting extraverted encounters become the barometer of all judgements in the social realm.

Reputation is a double-edged sword. It has a power like magic and whether the exact same deeds appears dreadful or brilliant, rakish or charming, can depend entirely on the reputation of the doer. Unfortunately, good reputation takes years to build and bad reputation spreads like wildfire.

It is very easy to tarnish other people's reputation. Sow the seeds of incriminating rumor and gossip does the rest. Want to catalyze the process and have a solid base of popularity? Use barbs, mockery and ridicule. You will not only succesffuly slandered your prey, but also draw more attention to you, enhancing your own reputation and popularity!

The above efforts work like a charm especially if your victim is a blank-slated introvert who is a stranger to even the closest of his friends. Don't be surprised when those who have known the target for years also start believing your version of him/her. And thanks to the social proof you would have amassed by now supporting your claim, dichotomy between the victim's true self and your broached version, will no longer be a barrier.

If you have been sufficiently successful till this step, as a side-effect, the victim's friends (if any) would have already left him/her or would be on the verge of leaving. Who likes to move around with jerks, imps, and losers? Afterall, people are judged based on their friends too!

Once, all above has been accomplished your victim must have already become a walking hollow person. Few more <>, few more public ridicules, few more <> and he/she would be ready. 

Not satisfied yet? Call in some bullies to add to his/her torment. Ask them to tyrannize him/her incessantly. Don't worry, there won't be any fighting back.

He/She will certainly be ready now. But ready for what?

The vivid picture of me standing on the fifth floor balcony ready to take the escape plunge and my friend's desperate attempts to stop me, is reforming in my head. His words that made me change my decision, echo - 

> "You may end your life but your sacrifice will be <pointless>. People will mention you for next few days and then you will be forgotten. And you will be remembered not as someone who was wronged, but as one who gave up. If you want that, then go ahead. I am not going to stop you...
But, if you want to be heard, if your want your plight to be seen, if you want your voice to fall on the deaf ears of those who have <wronged> you, learn to speak the language of the world. And there is only one language that the world listens to - the language of success. Failures are but <forgotten/remembered>."

Don't be swayed into believing I was prosecuted wrongly because in the "ideal" court of <>, judgements are not passed based on rhetoric of the accused. They are passed based on factual evidence and here is your edivence -
