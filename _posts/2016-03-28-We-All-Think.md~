//we all think but do we all think in the same space? Can thinking be wuantified in terms of depth, furtherness and width. (Think deep, far and wide.)

<opening dialogue>

I push myself back sitting in the cozy <what> chair in ccd and gaze in the eyes of my deep thinking mate. My eyes go blank and my mind gets lost in the depths of <what> thoughts. <Time seems to have frozen - describe.>

Gone are the days when not a single minute passed when we were not together however, one thing has remained invariant to the <what> effect of time (yet)- our "sadist self-introspection". (I know self introspection doesn't make sense but we like to call it that.) 

Ocassionally the two of us manage to make time out of our busy scehdules to touch base over a meal and discuss what we consider "deep stuff" concering life, universe and us.

An average human brain thinks <x> thoughts in day, that makes <x> thoughts an hour and <x> thoughts per minute. Now assuming an average IITian brain to be having atleast <x%> higher capability at thinking and folowing the <abc> theory, that makes it <x> thoughs crossing the IITian brain every minute. The irony - I can't help asking myself all the time "Why can't people think?"! Probably, the variance of our thoughts would be a better statistical measure but then I don't know of any method to measure that (I even don't know how the number of thoughts thought by the brain can be calculated, I just came across the number by Googling and saved myself from the trouble of figuring out how the number was reached).

The whimsical nature of majority has always puzzled me. As a kid I both loathed and envied kids around me who could go with the flow and unquestionably accept whatever the <society> told them. //elaborate

A quadruple of people come and occupy a nearby table. One of the guys (the despo girlfriend seeker) mocks one of the three guys - "Kya baat h, aaj usse fursat mil gyi" (Wow you managed to find time away from her). The other guy gives a conceited smile (well when the college gender ratio stands at m:f if you are one of those fortunate (unfortunate) guys to have a girlfriend you are expected to feel special) and says in an artifcially sad tone "han yaar aaj uske parents aye hn" (her parents are here today). I said an artificial sad tone because I know what his true feelings currently are - relief. He is relieved to have got a short repite when he can be himself and not a "dancing monkey" (sorry girls, no offence intended). Yet another friend comments "toh apne sas sasur se milne nhi jaega..." and I can feel the boyfriend give a sigh that gives away innumerable times he has been asked questioned for his long term relationship plans which he is procrastinating to make till the day either of them decides to break-up. His sigh is lost in the envious assertion of the forth friend - "Teri toh majje hi majje hn, bandi h, acchi company mein internship h... ppo bhi lgi hi jaega."

I take my attention away from their conversation because I know what all follows. //describe//. It's the one of the popular "meaningless" conversation that tempts me to make an artificial neural network - "Make IITian speak" (inpiration credits : 'Make Donald Trump Tweet'). Internship, placement, relationships, kattes (), TV Shows, chapos, assigments that were given a month earlier and somehow need to be completed in one evening and submitted before the mid-night deadline - that seems to exhaust the list of topics people seem to converse about. Ocassionally, fests, upcoming (and much needed) vacations, and upcoming (and dreaded) exams bring about the slight variety in our conversations without which <what would happen>.

No, I am no way implying that IITians (or any clan of people) can be clubbed together into a single species. No the human race is too diverse for that. All I wish to say is <what>.

"Are we the only few people who actually think <what>", I ask. My logical friend points out probably everyone around us thinks <what> but we can't say about them because they aren't that close to us. We are great friends who can confide in each other and are aware of each other's ability to think that's why we feel that we are the only ones thinking. Who knows, contrary to our beliefs, we might be the two shallowest people around!

This is not a point I can agree on because <why>

Probably it is not as much a question of capacity to think as much as it is a question of <a> choosing what to think.</a> //concept of dimensionality

I have known a parent who quit his job during the year his son had taken a drop to prepare for JEE and had gone to study in another city (where else but Kota - the hub for JEE preperation). The parent used to spend entire days sitting in the verandha thinking "What would happen if his son didn't qualify JEE", "Is he studying well.", "In which college to get him admitted to if the unfathomable event of his son not qualifying JEE occurred.", etc. Now I am not an expert on how thoughts become things <link to why secret is bs> but I don't believe the parent's <adj> thoughts could have helped his son in cracking JEE.

The human brain seems to be like a replicating machine that continues to produce the same thoughts till either <what happens> or <what hapens>. Even then we continue to cling on to the same genre of notions and ideas. 

Rather than a count of number of thoughts crossing our mind (measured using some <>) the volumetric measures of how deep we think, how far we think and how wide we think, combined with the statistical measure of variance will give a better comparision for the quality of our thoughts. 

The ubiquitous pop of Facebook messenger brings me back to earth. One of my classmates messaged me "ml ka tut kiya?" (have you solved the machine learning tutorial?). "Abe aaj last date h ml ka assignment submit krne ki" I assert to my friend sitting across the table. I quickly finish my choco latte and we head back to the hostel. On the way my friend asks "By the way, have you watched this TV Show ..."

//The END  awesome
