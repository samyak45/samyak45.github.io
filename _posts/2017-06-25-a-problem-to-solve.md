January 2016: I was out on a walk with a distressed junior. He had been beating himself up at his abysmal performance in the previous semester exam, having "wasted" his winter vacations by not learning anything, not being able to code, and not being good at anything that can assure him a job or admission for higher education post college. I tried assuring that he still can sort his life and offered suggestions as to how he can do so. In reply, he gave me sufficient "reasons" (excuses) to why he can't do anything about anything to convince me that his life was indeed f***ed up (because he just won't do anything for it not to be so). Few minutes into the silence of my having run out of suggestions suddenly his face lightened up and he said - "Aur kuch nhi kr paya toh start-up krlunga, then toh kmana hi kmana h". 

It was one of those 'WTF!' moments for me that make you question the stupidity and irrationality till which the world could go. Here was a guy barely capable of passing the institute exams, not having any sellable skill, or exceptional talent, or background, or experience; and he thinks if nothing else he can at least start-up. Either the ongoing entrepreneurial wave had made starting-up exceptionally easy or people in IITR had started viewing entrepreneurship as the last resort for those who cannot do anything else in life.

Anyone else might have internally (and maybe even externally) laughed at the ludicrousness of my fellow companion's assertion and let it pass. But I was curious to know what was up.

Over the following weeks, I discussed this incident with numerous seniors, alums, juniors, and batchmates. The realizations: 

1. None of the uber talented people I talked to had plans to start-up in the foreseeable future. Even those who saw the entrepreneurial life path more fulfilling (albeit the risk), didn't see themselves equipped with the knowledge, skills, and experience for building a successful start-up. 

2. Most people starting-up in IITR were very much like my aforementioned junior - people who chose entrepreneurship as the last resort. Not surprisingly, start-ups by such incapable founders always failed. The situation was in sharp contrast with that found in leading institutes of the world where the people who start-up are amongst the most talented of individuals in their respective batch.

3. The number of startups coming out of IIT Roorkee was significantly lower than those coming out of other IITs. 

4. Maximum start-ups in IITR shut down within one year of launch. The reasons for shutting down commonly being not having done proper requirement analysis, and feasibility study before launch and/or not having sufficient business acumen to take things forward.

5. We were not starting ventures aimed at improving the world, the society or the environment. The power of business of making a positive change in the world was getting overlooked and the word startup had become associated with making web/mobile-application that provide consumer convenience and make a profit in the process.

A problem stared at my face: In the startup space, IITR was lacking in yield, quality, and cause. The entrepreneurship culture in IIT Roorkee needed a revamp. Those who had the potential and a desire (even if hidden) to be entrepreneurs and change makers needed direction. Else IIT Rookee would fail to produce world leaders and change makers it is supposed to.

The next 1.5 years of my college life were devoted to solving this problem.
