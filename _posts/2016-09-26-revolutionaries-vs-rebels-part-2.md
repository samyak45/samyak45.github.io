In Part-1, I talked about the definitions of rebels and revolutionaries and we tried to understand how do they look like behind their public demeanor. If you haven't read that post, I recommend reading it first. 

In this post I will attempt to decipher the difference in approach towards change taken up by both revolutionaries and rebels and how their respective personalities shape the movement they are a part of. I will dig into the lives of some revolutioary rebels to look at how does it look like when a revolution becomes a rebellion or when a rebellion is used to bring a revolution. Finally I will conclude and try to build a consensus on how and why we need both of these forces to drive the world forward.

Irrespective of whether or not we are a part of a <national/international> movement, rebellion and revolution are two agents of change that never abandon us. They shape us and our world. From having shaped the history of our world (which in turn is responsible for our present) to  deciding the future course of the organizations we work for and the industries we work in, from determining how our past idiosyncrasies have shaped our current reputations to how our superiors and our colleagues are gonna respond to them now, from determining whether we will be just dismissed as another crazy person with a crazy idea or remembered as an individual who transfigured a domain.

Whether you are someone aspiring to bring a change or someone following others trying to or just a silent spectator, understanding the rebell mindset and the revolutionary mindset can help in making better decisions and getting better outcomes.

#Target of Attack

As mentioned towards the end of Part-1, the core difference between a rebel and a revolutionary lies in the fact that while a rebel stands against something (e.g. colonisation, apartheid, poverty, etc), a revolutionary stands for something (e.g. people's rights, equality, better livelihood). 

However, as any <adj> movement progresses forward, these distinctions in <viewpoint/outlook> blur in since, advocating for new systems often requires demolishing the old way of doing things and engaging in acts of creative destruction. 

#Different Approaches

The demarcation between rebels and revolutionaries lies in how they approach the different element of change and their motivations.

#Earning Status vs Disregarding Status Quo

When was the last time you entered a new society/ a new class/ a new organization and started suggesting in your initial days on how things can be done differently? What was the reaction of those around you? And if you managed to not give up on your idea and persevered there long enough, how were your suggestions then received?

Unless you were not known to be a rockstar of the field prior to entering or unless you managed to find an institution that truly appreciates speaking up with suggestions, it's likely that in the former case, even if your insights were indeed revolutionizing, you were squashed and got replies like "You just don't get it.", "This is not how things are done here.". In the latter case people would have lend you an ear, applauded you and even implemented your suggestions (even if they weren't truly worth implementing).

What leads to this difference in reception? Was it that the initial suggestions were not founded on solid ground and the later ones were more in sync with reality? Possibly but not necessarily. Even the exact same idea communicated in the two scenrios will be received as mentioned.

The difference lies in the words 'credibility', 'respect' and 'status'.

Power and status are not the same. Power is related with having influence (on others), status is about having the right to exercise power. Trying to exercise power without status is like trying to demolish a 100ft castle with 5ft thick boundary walls and a 20ft high metal gate using just your physical strength. With status, it's like "Well I don't exactly need to demolish this castle since I own it anyway".

Revolutionaries understand the value of status and know how to use it to achieve their objectives. Their operations are targeted towards rising up, gaining entry into the castle and then eventually conquering it from within. On the other hand, rebels completely disregard the status quo and attack the system from below.

No colonial government would tolerate a skinny <> year old man wearing lion cloth who is trying to create a ruckass by violating every other law they come up with. Unless that person earned the status, admiration and people's respect to make them fear simply shoving him off. And every other militant trying to surge terror would, at best, be subjected to trial and prosecuted.

The revolutionaries earn respect and admiration not only of the people they are fighting for but also of the establishment they are fighting against. This to an extent that the opposition begins to take their counsel to save itself!

“The way to come to power is not always to merely challenge the Establishment, but first make a place in it and then challenge and double-cross the Establishment.” - Francis Ford Coppola


#Incremental Change vs Complete Overhaul

(To the reader) Let me claim - "Your parents raised you wrong. Your school and college taught you wrong and your life till now has been anything but a lie. You will have to start all over again." An inane assertion, right?

Now what if I subtly say, "You are alright but you can do <something> better by making these adaptations." You might heed this suggestion.

A rebel will adopt the former approach; a revoluionary, the latter.

With their aspirations based on a utopian ideology, rebels often fail to foresee the repercusions of their stringent methods on themselves, the people around them and the institutions they are a part of. Very often in their "genuine struggle" for change, they jeopardize everyone's lives, freedom, or livelihoods. Historically, all mass rebellions have been marked with massive bloodshed.

Certain times do necessitate inharmonious measures and they might be the only <thing/force> saving the <victims> from oblivion. At other times, a more diplomatic approach can be used.

Revolutioaries bring radical transformations however, the transformation is incremental. Every revolution for national independence started as a moment seeking to extricate people from unjust laws. They start with aggreements were reached for both sides to find middle-ground and gradually proceed towards annihilating their nemesis, at every step using some trojan horse to mask their true objectives.


#Power of Idealism vs Power of Conscience

We all ocasionally come across person who are guided more by ideals than by practical considerations. People who often fail to see the flaw in themselves and in their fellow human beings. Rebels form the purest brand of idealists. 

Rebels are dreamers who tend to believe that once there rebellion has successfully accomplished it's objective, everything will be great and everyone will be happy. They can't be more out of sync with reality.

<how this affects the course of their actions>

Oftentimes, freedom can be more perishing than suppression. The unwarranted repercussions of mass rebellions can be far-reaching and can result in <>.

Have you ever come across the rare lot of people who have an inborn sense of idealism and morality, who tend to see helping others as their purpose in life and are often seen engaging in rescue efforts and doing charity work but whose real passion is to get to the heart of the issue so that people need not be rescued at all. People who advocate egalitarianism and they tend to believe that nothing would help the world so much as using love and compassion to soften the hearts of tyrants. But who aren't ideal dreamers and take concrete steps to realize their humanitarian vision.

That's the potrait of a revolutionary. 

Revolutionaries are people of conscience who believe in karma and pioneer the belief that means are as important as the end. 

<how this manifests into their actions>




#Struggle of the masses vs Elitist Struggle

The <> nature of rebellion restricts it to few (really?).

#When revolution becomes a rebellion - Che Guevera, The Revolutionary Rebel

#digitalizing 
<conclusion>

From the top of my head, my closing thoughts are - 

I have been wasting my time and my readers time trying to make an unnecessary comparision. 

IMO, both are nuthead extremists but hey, only <nutheads> like these have been known to bring marked transormations!

I am just a <laid back/lazy> incorrigible rebel.

Now the conclusion that is expected from a 'serious' blogpost as this - 

<Both are necessary>

Throughout history, rebels have demonstrated how a small group of motivated people passionately united towards a cause, no matter what, can achive much more than what a large crowd of unmotivated people seperated by their internal conflicts can ever do. However, rebels' bold actions, ferocious comments and <terrorizing <>> raise rivals quick, even among the people they are fighting for. Consequently, rebels don't last long however, in their short period they make a difference most others cannot make in a dozen life spans.

<how revolutionaries take the baton set by rebels forward>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rebels blame their enemy for all that's wrong and believe defeating the enemy will make everyting perfect. Revolutionaries are more pragmatic. They double-cross...

A rebel, contemptous of <> desires to knock down <>. A revolutionary plans to erect <a better wall> and does what it takes (knocking down or <>) to accomplish his plans. 

<complete overhaul vs incremental progress> 

<rebels take a 0 1 approach, see world as white and black -- this is good because it provides a radical approach as apposed to one provided by diplomatic revolutionaries but maybe infeasible - even if rebels win, the vistory might not lead to the perfect things they dreamt of e.g. Che Guevera -- but then does this mean revolutionaries lead to perfect outcomes? certainly the indo-pak splitup says otherwise. Well all such complete reestablishment is going to create powerful destructive waves but in the long run revolution serves to be better than rebellions.Rebels rush in. 

A rebel hates the establishment so much that he/she will prefer no establishment at all the one currently in place. A revolutionary loves his <dreamt establishment> that he can't be satisfied with anything less <>.


A perfect example of how <the gap fills in> is of Che Guevera. 

Another example comes from India's struggle for freedom. Mahatma Gandhi and 

But, despite how the <differences are covered up>. The fundamental difference in <vision> remains and continues to affect the way in which <...>. Revolutionaries listen, reflect and then speak/act. Rebels <do what>.

<fundamental approach idiosncracy credits, exercising power, becoming part of status quo.>

<conluding remarks -- need for rebels, creating waves, this article might be a little biased, bias spurs from my infatuation with planning and sophistication as apposed to blunt action>

In an organization, a rebel tries to exercise influence from below <...>. <..>

The <last> difference reminds me of <investopedia>. 

<Mahatma Gandhi>



Ironically while we use the term revolutionaries for both scientific and social stuff, in scientific revolutions we <understad> that coming up with new theories requires understanding pre-existing ones, in social we take it for granted that <... no pact, fight>.

I will close by suggesting a way to identify a revolutioary, rebel and confirmist in a <>. Ask <...>.

The confirmist would,

The rebel would,

The revolutionary would, 



While revolutionaries see the world differently and don't accept the status quo, they aren't necessarily your <something analogous>. Revolutionaries are people who take radical risks and are as <what> of going against the tide as the so called "confirmist majority". What makes them different is <what>.

Rebels on the other hand are people who <do what>. True rebels due to <what> might be almost as unlikely as those who accept the <status quo> to 'change the world'. Rebels apparently are people who could have revolutionized industries and changed midsets only if they had taken some time to understand their fellow beings and had learnt to keep quiet when they were better off not speaking.

I also realized that confirmists in no single category either. There are different types of confirmists. We have followers and we have acceptors.

Followers are true confirmists who <do what>.

On the other hand acceptors are people who <do what>. 

But very few are true followers or true acceptors, most lie somewhere in between. Even rebels lie on this confirmity scale if it is extrapolated <till what>. xD

So, how do you thing recognize a follower, an acceptor, a rebel and a revolutionary ? Well, all you need to do is <arrange for conversation> and converse on a slightly controverial topic. 

The follower will <do what>.

The acceptor would <do what>.

The rebel - wait, do I even need to be reminded of how to recognize a <adj adj rebel during a conversation>? Well I just did!

The revolutionary - I am still to come across a revolutionary but I would expect him/her to be a good listener who listens to arguments, reflects, comes up with an unbiased analysis and based on his understanding of the people around expresses his/her thouhgt in manner that <would what>.

I would close with one of my favourite quotes :

"<quote>".

Here I am no way calling myself a revolutioary not because <> but because <>.
