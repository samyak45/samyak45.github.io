> A blogpost where I discuss the cornerstones of a more successful and fulfilling life - 'WHAT', 'HOW' and the 'WHY'.

Scrolling through my Facebook news feed I stumble upon an article titled ["Do you know your why?"]().

The "WHAT", the "HOW" and the "WHY" are three cornerstones of living a more fulfilling and meaningful life. They are universal and applicable to individuals, organizations and communities alike.

The 'WHAT' gives us the vision, the 'HOW' gives us the process or methodology, and the 'WHY' gives us the reason.

> WHAT <- Vision
> HOW <- Process
> WHY <- Reason

Your vision — or your “mission statement” — declares where you (or your organization) is headed and what it will look like when it's arrived. It tells you what success (for you) looks like. How else will you know when you’ve achieved it? 

> "If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will take you there."

A vision forces you to really know your ambitions and declares the outcomes you expect, becoming a guiding light to lead you forward. Without a vision individuals and enterprises would be directionless and will not have anything to fall back on when plans go south and objectives are not met.

Any map/strategic plan/process is useless if you don't know where you are going. Once you get (crystal) clear on WHAT you want, the HOW (almost) takes care of itself. 

The 'WHAT' always need to come before the 'HOW'. Being more concerned about the 'HOW' too early inhibits your vision and blocks you from thinking as big as you need to think. What you need is a vision that is so big that it is compelling, not only to others but to you. A compelling vision gives the motivation required to stay the course and also urges others to your assistance.

If vision is all that was required, then daydreamers (myself included) would already be world leaders, top researchers and CEOs of corporate behemoths! Once you have figured out 'WHAT' you wish to do, you ought to figure out 'HOW' you plan on doing it. You must know the sequence of actions that need to be taken to achieve your goal and answering the 'HOW' is figuring out that required sequence of actions. 

The 'HOW' provides you a roadmap, an itinerary to reach your destination. It helps in estabilishing (sub)goals that need to be achieved to progress towards our primary goal ('WHAT'). It equips us with a tool to see how much we have progressed towards our goals and how far we are from our respective destinations. Knowing where you are is essential for making good decisions on where to go or what to do next. Without a detailed roadmap, you will be left wandering aimlessly, get lost and soon run out of time and other resources.

Additionally, careful planning helps in managing risks and uncertainty. With careful planning, you often can see if at some point you are likely to face a problem and it is much easier to adjust your plan to avoid or smoothen a coming crisis, rather than to deal with the crisis when it comes unexpected.

Imagine trying to find your way around a strange city—but where your road map shows a zoo you find a shopping mall, and where it indicates a route to the beach you find that it dead-ends at a train station. After a few such experiences, you may question the usefulness of the map—and then examine it and to your dismay discover that it was drawn in 1890. If you want to get to where you want to go, you’d better get a new road map!

The takeaway of ^^ : the 'HOW' is liable to change as external factors change. There is a constant need to improvise else we will be left exploring a new terrain with an old roadmap. 

Alright so you ought to know 'WHAT' you are doing and 'HOW' you are going to do it (- that's common sense) but do you know the 'WHY' you are doing it in the first place ?

If you go into something not knowing your "why", whether it is fitness, business, relationships or anything that makes your life better, chances of failure are high. 

[Know your "WHY?"](http://www.forbes.com/sites/margiewarrell/2013/10/30/know-your-why-4-questions-to-tap-the-power-of-purpose/#45ce8c4a564e)

Not knowing 'WHY' you wish to create 'WHAT' you wish to create (or are in the process of creating) will leave you driveless and unmotivated in no time. Every time, someone will ridicule your vision you will be left questioning it yourself and give in to the comments and criticism of the belittlers and give up on the vision. If you can't answer the WHY, people will not take you seriously, investors(if required) won't fund your endeavor and friends & family will either not support you or support you half-heartedly. 'WHY' is the foundation or soul of your endeavour and nothing great was ever built on a shaky foundation. 

So, [start with why](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7108725-start-with-why) (a good business book to learn from).

![and-or-tree](http://samyakchoudhary.com/img/and-or-tree.png){: .center-image }

The CS-AI geek in me models the "What, How, Why" in the form of interlinked [AND-OR trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And%E2%80%93or_tree). 

The nodes of the trees are goals or sub-goals. In order to achieve a goal you need to achieve a conjunction of sub-goals (children of the goal node connected by an arc) however, there might be alternative ways to achieve any goal i.e. a disjunction (of conjunctions) exists. 

Unlike traditional AND-OR trees in which each child has a single parent, in the search space (our life) a child can have multiple parents i.e after achieving certain sub-goals we can proceed forward to achieve multiple goals. 

Now here is the catch, in the end, we cannot be at multiple root nodes. Of all the possible root nodes at which we can be, only one is the 'victory node' while the rest are 'traps' or deadends. But we traverse the tree bottom up so, how do we avoid false paths leading us to trap (dead end) nodes? We make use of 'WHY links'! 

When achieving the sub-goals becomes timeconsuming and overly demanding, we might lose our way (and other searchers of the search space will mostly confuse us since they might not be related by blood). The 'WHY links' are backlinks from children to parents, helping the child in distinguishing the 'true' parent from the impostors. They are like reminders - "Ok, I achieved this sub-goal but why did I want to achieve this in the first place? To achieve get to this parent goal and not these parent goals."

Thinking of 'WHAT', 'HOW' and the 'WHY' reminds me of the life story of Santiago Calatrava - the architect, cum civil engineer, cum artist who designed the Milwaukee Art Museum. The museum consists of a long glass-and-steel reception hall with an eighty-foot ceiling, all shaded by an enormous movable sunscreen at the roof. The screen has two ribbed panels that open and close like the wings of a giant seagull, putting the entire edifice into motion and giving the sense of a building that could take flight!

At a very early age, Santiago Calatrava developed a love for drawing. A certain paradox in drawing began to obsess him - "how to capture the true essence of life - everything in a state of change and motion - on paper, in an image that was perfectly still?"

He took classes and learned techniques for creating the various illusions of something caught in the moment of movement, but it was never quite enough. As a part of this impossible quest he taught himself aspects of mathematics, such as descriptive geometry, that could help him understand how to represent his objects in two dimensions. His skill improved and his interest in the subject deepened. It seemed he was destined for a career as an artist, and so he enrolled in an art school in Valencia.

A few months int his studies, he had a seemingly minor experience that would change the course of his life : browsing for supplies in a stationery store, his eye was drawn to a beautifully designed booklet describing the work of the great architect Le Corbusier. Somehow this architect had managed to create completely distinctive shapes. He turned even something as simple as a stairway into a dynamic piece of sculpture. The buildings he designed simply seemed to defy gravity, creating a feeling of movement in their still forms. Studying this booklet, Calatrava now developed a new obsession - to learn the secret of how such buildings came about. As soon as he could, he transferred to an architecture school.

Graduating from the architecture school, Calatrava had gained a solid foundation in the subject and was more than capable of taking his place in some architecture firm and working his way up. But he realized that while knew more than enough about the form and asthetics of the great works of architecture he most admired -  the Pantheon in Rome, the buildings of Gaudi in Barcelona, the bridges designed by Robert Maillart in Switzerland - ,he knew nothing about how they sttod up, how the pieces fit together, how the buildings of Le Corbusier (his inspiration mentioned above) managed to create that impression of movement and dynamism.

It was like knowing how to draw a beautiful bird but not understanding how it could fly. As with drawing, he wanted to go beyond the surface, the design element, and touch upon the reality. He felt that the world was changing; something was in the air. With advances in technology and new materials, revolutionary possibilities had emerged for a new kind of architecture, but to truly exploit that he would have to learn engineering. So, he made the fateful decision to virtually start over and again enroll into university to gain a degree in civil engineering.

After years of rigorous labour in the engineering college, driven by his childhood obsession to express movement and change, Santiago emerged as a "master" in civil engineering and architecture; one who broke the golden rule of architecture - "the buildings have to be stable and stationary" with his design and constructions, including but not limited to the avant-garde Milwaukee Art Museum.

So, Calatrava knew his 'WHAT' (addressing the paradox of expressing movement and change in static structures), he knew his 'WHY' (capturing the true essence of life) and he worked towards figuring out, and then implementing, the 'HOW'. There were false paths that he could have got on but he didn't and that made him one of the most renowned architects of his time, one who revolutionized the complete science of architecture.

Some web-person once told me good designers who can write their own design code are like goldflakes in the industry. I could immediately relate this to the combination of 'WHAT' with 'HOW'. Certainly it is more convenient and high-yielding to have one person to knowing both what to create and how to create than to have the what person (the designer) explain things to the how person (the developer).

While it is always better to have a single individual knowing both the 'WHAT' and the 'HOW', such individuals are as rare as unicorns. Most of the time chasing one makes us lose sight of the other. The alternative - teaming up (especially if you aspire to put a ding in the world, create ground-breaking technologies and revolutionary enterprises).

The 'WHAT' person and the 'HOW' person can be complementary opposites, taking their combined endeavor forward through their collaborative efforts. The leading exemplar - the Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Wozniak (obviously). The team could be better if the 'WHYs' of more compatible and the demarcation lines between the 'WHAT' and the 'HOW' person are less stringent. Then we can have something like Google (and yes, in the fight between Apple and Google, I will pick up Google every single time. Same goes for Android vs iOS).

Whether you are an entrepreneur or a "9 to 5 job person", a savvy researcher or an ordinary user, an engineer or a manager, the 3 cornerstones 'WHAT', 'HOW' and 'WHY' govern your life.

So start asking yourself 'WHAT', 'HOW' and the 'WHY' (if you haven't started  already).
