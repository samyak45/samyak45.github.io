**Tony Stark is a brilliant comic character.**

By that I don't mean comic as in comic book - I mean comic as in comedy, and yes, Tony Stark is a "comic" character.

When you are writing comedy, there is this concept known as the "comic gap." It is the difference between the world as it actually exists and the world as it is being portrayed in the joke.

"I met a guy walking down the street who said to me 'I haven't had a bite all day.' So I bit him."

The gap is between the reality - "needing a bite means he is hungry," to the comic reality, "needing a bite means he needed me to bite him." The gap, combined with the surprise of its existence, makes it funny.

When you are writing a comic character in particular, the comic gap manifests in the **difference between the comic character's perspective on reality and how reality actually is**.

Take Sheldon Cooper in The Big Bang Theory for example. He has a perspective on reality where everything is hyper-rational and logical. The comedy his character produces lies in his friends acting consistently with "normal" reality and "normal" behaviors, and his interpretations of them from his strong and very different perspective.

One of the keys to writing good comedy is exaggeration, so when you're writing a comic character, whatever their comic perspective is, it's always best to take that perspective to the extreme.

Tony Stark's perspective is "I am the most badass, most intelligent, most epic human being who's ever existed and no one can match me." No matter what comes his way, even if he's abducted by terrorists in the desert, this paradigm lives on. It is dauntless. It defines him, and it's interesting to see how his perspective interacts with the real world.

Once your character has a strong comic perspective established, the next step is to give the character **flaws**. Flaws allow your audience to put distance between themselves and the character so they can watch the interplay between the character and reality, rather than getting caught up in the character. They can laugh when bad things happen to the character.

Tony has myriad flaws. He's arrogant, sociopathic, pompous, impulsive, stubborn, and overconfident. These flaws manifest from his comic perspective and intensify it, and it's interesting to see them get him into trouble, but for him to continue moving ahead in spite of them because of his strong perspective.

Finally, once we have established flaws, we need to **reestablish the character's humanity**. We are still supposed to like this character, so for each of his flaws there needs to be some noble characteristics that make us like him again. Charlie Brown's flaws are that he's such a downer and gullible, but he also never gives up. He will try to kick that football every time it's put in front of him. We simultaneously laugh at him for his flaw and love him for his persistence.

Tony is witty, intelligent, emotionally torn by his relationship with his father, desperate to help his friends, suffering from PTSD, heroic, and charming. He suffers inner conflicts and wrestles with his emotions. This endears him to us and makes us like him. The combination of flaws and humanity lets us distance him from us, allowing us to laugh at him, and feel like he is just like us, allowing us to feel for him.

That's why we find Tony Stark to be such a compelling character. He's well-written.
