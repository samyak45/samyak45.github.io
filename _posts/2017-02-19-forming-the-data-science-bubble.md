September 15, 2008; March 10, 2000; October 29, 1929; May 10, 1837 - dates that shudder the soul of any economist; dates highlighted in red in the <history> of <adj> economy crashes and bubble burst; dates when on a single day millions became jobless, companies bankrupt, and society went in a downward spiral recovering from which took years, often decades.



Back in 2014 when I was in the first year of college, the terms "Machine Learning" and "Data Science" were quite unknown. I was one of the pioneers who started exploring this field of computer science in my batch. Getting guidance and finding people having similar interest was difficult.

Since then the machine learning trend has been moving at breakthrough speed with internship and job interiews covering it, start-ups coming up in the domain, and college communities revolving around it. Today, I find 7 out of 10 people learning machine learning and planning for a future in the data science industry. This infatuation spreads from alums who graduated few years ago to the freshmen, from people studying computer science to <>. The guys in the electronics section are <>. The softeare development enthusiasts <>. The people managing the mess are <>.

A similar trend can be seen in academia, industry and research across the globe. 

Why the hype? 

"<the most sort after job>"
"<xxx number of jobs to be created>"
"<there is hardly any industy that can't be revolutionized through data science>"

The power of data to improve business decisions and better understand community, customers and trends in unquestionable. However, seeing the this sudden <>, the precacious critique in me has started to become apprehensive of an upcoming economic crash.

<comparision to the dot com bubble>
<comparision to the housing prices bubble>
<comparision to financial crisis ... lehman brothers>

All these cases follow a similar trajectory - eruption, frenzy, crash and turn, golden age, maturity.

Data science is in the frenzy phase. Crash will come. How it might come and what it might look like. Follows the golden age. So what should you do - if you are entering the field, be vary about a crash and be prepared. If you are someone like me who is willing to be patient, wait till the golden age (eg Google after the dot com bubble burst).
