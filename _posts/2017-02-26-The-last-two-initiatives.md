Both initiatives spring from what has appalled me since last 4 years of college. In fact, since school life. Conformism in people, their relauctance in trying out new things and their not taking bold initiatives to solve problems.

Enactus IIT Roorkee:

The first initiative is aimed at making people in IITR more enterprising. Very few people from IITR start new ventures - be it start-ups, or unconventional and innovative projects in their jobs. (Several things are to blame. Largely the structured approach to preparing for JEE which inhibits explorative learning and makes us believe there is some THE path to success.)

There is a lacking in both the entrepreneurial mindset and skillset. Reading about entrepreneurship or even about business doesn't make you an entrepreneur. The only way to learn is by doing. (Oh, and the Entrepreneurship Development Cell that should be working on all this has become just an events management group). 

On the sidelines is also the lack of a greater cause for taking initiatives. Since entrepreneurship can be and should be a way to improve lives.

Recognizing that the risk and high demanding nature of starting up is what keeps people at bay, I contemplated over ways to mitigate risk, and make the efforts less arduous.  I thought, maybe, short-term projects on an established platform, a platform that is aligned with the core vision and infused with a spirit of competition, might give just that.

After searching through numerous platforms, most of which were either business challenges that only required presenting and not doing, and/or were not well established in India, I stumbled across 'Enactus'. 

Enactus is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to inspiring students to improve the world through entrepreneurial action. It is spread across 36 countries, has more than 1700 participating universities and 70,000+ participating students, working together on over 4900 projects annually. In India itself, it has gained 98 participating teams and more than 3000 students involved in over 120 projects.

Enactus is one of the most established platform for social entrepreneurship and one that doesn't restrict to some specific segement, problem, or domain.

What do Enactus students do?

Identify community problems.
Create innovative business models to address the problems.
Act and create impact. (focus on scalability and sustainability of business)
Compete with other Enactus teams at the national and international level.

The core benefit of using Enactus is it's brand value. It is supported by some of the best companies in the world, who recognize the value of Enactus experience and compete very aggressively for the opportunity to meet and recruit Enactus students. The tag also helps in building a profile for applying to international universities for higher education since, work done to uplift the society and experience of working in entrepreneurial ventures is highly accredited by universities.

In a nushell, participating in Enactus can:

Provide us with the opportunity to **make a meaningful difference** in the community, while gaining the **experience, skills and contacts necessary to build a successful career**.
Make us a **part of an established global community** of social entrepreneurs and business leaders. 
Initiate a **culture of social entrepreneurship** in the college.
**Improve lives** of people in and around IIT Roorkee.
**Foster entrepreneurial thinking, leadership skills and business acumen** in the students.
Provide students a **scaffold for a more promising future**. 
Give us a an opportunity to Represent IIT Roorkee at a global level.
