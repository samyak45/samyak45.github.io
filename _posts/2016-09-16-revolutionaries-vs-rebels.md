How are wide-ranging disruptive transformations affected? And what are the protagonists behind these transformations like?

With insolence, she said - "I was appreciative of the revolutionary I used to see in you, but alas you seem to have locked your rebellious streak inside some trunk and submerged the trunk in the shallow cruddy sea of social acceptance.

Unable to see the world as the shades of gray it is, we see it as a black and white and despite limited experiences, begin to question the time-honored social machinery. Without taking the time to better understand the world and the people around us, we start envisioning to scrub off the greasy stains from this world and make it the "heavenly place" it should have already been when we were born!)

[//]: <> ("Inorder to win wars we can't afford to lose, we need to stop waging battles one can be indifferent to.", I said. Refuting her acute accusations through a combination of logic and emotions superficially, I began to question my integrity internally. While I explained how in order to win wars we can't afford to lose, we need to stop waging battles one can be indifferent to, I began to wonder if I had already lost the war whose battle flags I was blazing.)

With insolence she said - "I looked up to the revolutionary I used to see in you, but alas you seem to have locked your rebellious streak inside some trunk and submerged the trunk in the shallow cruddy sea of social acceptance. Congrats, you are almost there to becoming another adult accepting defaults."

"Inorder to win wars one can't afford to lose, one needs to stop waging battles he/she can be indifferent to.", I refuted.

To better understand my own argument, I decided to sift through the lives of people who have brought radical social changes - both in fiction and in real life. I arrived at the following findings after discussing with friends over overstretched lunchtime conversations, reading biographies of people who have dismantled and remolded the world, (re)watching relevant movies and TV-Shows, and spending hours contemplating over raw facts and trying to connect them.

[//]: <> (Soon, my mulling turned towards sifting the definitions of rebels and revolutionaries. "What does it mean to be a revolutionary or a rebel?" "What are the two like behind their public demeanor?" "Are all revolutionaries rebels? If not, what is the difference between them?")

Two identified ways of bringing radical transformations are - 1. The rebel way and, 2. The revolutionary way.

Wait!

Why read this post about revolutionaries and rebels (apart from because we have nothing more subtantial to do)? Not many, if any, amongst us might be currently involved in some mass movement aspiring to break untenable antediluvian norms or overthrow some tyrant.

My claim - 

Every day, we all encounter things we love and things that need to change. The former give us joy. The latter fuel our desire to make the world different—ideally better than the way we found it. But trying to change deep-seated beliefs and behaviors is daunting. Most accept the status quo because effecting real change seems impossible, some fight against it and very few manage to dismantle deep setted beliefs and redefine what the world believes in.

Irrespective of whether or not we are a part of a movement, rebellion and revolution are two agents of change that never abandon us. They shape us and our world. From having shaped the history of our world (which in turn is responsible for our present) to deciding the future course of the organizations we work for and the industries we work in, from determining how our past idiosyncrasies have shaped our current reputations to how our superiors and our colleagues are gonna respond to them now, from determining whether we will be just dismissed as another crazy person with a crazy idea or remembered as an individual who transfigured a domain.

Whether you are someone aspiring to bring a change or someone following others trying to or just a silent spectator, understanding the rebell mindset and the revolutionary mindset can help in making better decisions and getting better outcomes.

So, who are these rebels and revolutionaries? How are they different? and (most importantly), How do they accomplish the daunting task of unsettling time-honored social machineries and establishments?

> "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has." - Margaret Mead

Rebels and revolutionaries are two different (though not completely disjoint) breeds of insurgents. Both loathe untenable antediluvian norms. The divergence lies in the approach they take to debunk them. The difference is subtle but clear.

(It might be helpful to visualize Bhagat Singh, Che Guevera and Paan Singh Tomar as rebels and people like Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Nelson Mandela as revolutionaries for the remaining of this article.)

**Who are rebels?**

Do I really need to tell you who these conceited, egotistical, mutinous troublemakers with no regard for rules, regulations or authority are? 

(Considering the rising unrest in this world, I can only assume that the population of rebels is on a rise. Or probably it's just that like attracts like and without my knowledge, I have recently been pushed into the 'Rebel Worldcup'!)

Anyway, rebels resist authority, control, tradition and conformity inorder to promote or preserve their personal autonomy. They are drawn towards seeking aesthetic perfection and their orientation is highly individualistic.

(And the most charming maverick of all - Me!)

Noteworthiness, rarity, distinctiveness, individuality and/or the unusual, idiosyncratic or eccentric are the characters rebels value most highly in themselves and others.

These are idealists who have high standards and seek excellence in whatever they do. They believe that what is perfect but unavailable or unattainable is infinitely more desirable than what is flawed but possible or achievable. 

When you look at their lives, you always find them reaching for the unreachable star.

A typical idealist rebel's dialogue -

> “And maybe there’s no peace in this world, for us or for anyone else, I don’t know. But I do know that, as long as we live, we must remain true to ourselves.”  - Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) in Spartacus

**Who are revolutionaries?**

Consider yourself lucky if you have ever encountered this rare breed. And I take my hat off to you if you successfully endured the inborn sense of morality and virtuous nature that makes everyone else's distress over personal life issues seem pitiful. (Though, I don't wear a hat.)

Revolutionaries work for a political or social change and their orientation is toward changing and improving society. Motivated towards seeking moral and ethical perfection, revolutionaries believe they could do better, others could improve and the world could be a better place.

Think these -

![Dumbledore](http://samyakchoudhary.com/img/dumbledore.jpg){: .center-image }

![Batman](http://samyakchoudhary.com/img/the-dark-knight.jpg){: .center-image }

(Katniss can't be a revolutionary. She is such a crybaby. Dumbledore and Batman are more of rebels. Right? Well, this blogpost is meant just for you dear reader and it might change your complete notion of revolutionaries. Read along!)

Revolutionaries feel responsible for the greater good and for doing good. They wrestle with how far they should go in seeking justice and fairness for others, in exposing corruption and injustice or in standing up against evil or wrong-doing. They worry about with what is the higher duty and what exactly is required of them in response.

Note that these aren't idle dreamers, but people capable of taking concrete steps to realize their goals and make a lasting positive impact. They are decisive and strong-willed, and share a very unique combination of traits: though soft-spoken, they have very strong opinions and will fight tirelessly for an idea they believe in.

They are people of conscience who cause revolution to conform society, as a whole, to a higher moral or ethical standard.

As we trace the lives of several revolutionaries, we locate a common thread of virtue connecting their life events. Over the course of their lives, these individuals are drawn further and further down the path of righteousness. They are compelled to do one small thing, then another and another until, in the end, they have sacrificed their personal concerns, their safety, their security, their family, their fortunes or often their lives.

Typical revolutionary monotone -

> “Wherever there’s a fight, so hungry people can eat, I’ll be there. Wherever there’s a cop beating up a guy, I’ll be there. I’ll be in the way guys yell when they are mad. I’ll be in the way kids laugh when they are hungry and they know supper’s ready, and when the people are eating the stuff they raise and living in the houses they build– I’ll be there, too.” - Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) in The Grapes of Wrath


**Revolutionaries behind their public demeanor**

People's proclivity of remembering revolutionaries by their impeccable public facade is classic. But here let's try to see what revolutionaries actually are behind their popular demeanor.

![Martin Luther King, Jr.](http://samyakchoudhary.com/img/martin-luther-king-dream-speech.jpg){: .center-image }

To substantially overturn an old system, one needs to be completely at odds with it. This belief is embedded so deeply in our cultural psyche that we rarely even stop to think about it. We see world changers as people who are impervious to opposition and simply don’t worry about the costs of non-conformity the way the rest of us do. Diplomacy and compromise don't seem to be the personality traits of individuals who drive change in the world. Right?

I will backpedal on this myth that has been cajoled into us by mythified stories of revolution and world change.

We see revolutionaries as free thinking idealists who, untethered by social proof, incessantly rebut theories, ideas, and practices they don't believe in. They are seen as paragons of obstinate confidence. The image of a mutineer erupts in our heads when we come across the word "revolutionary". This image is nothing but a mirage. 

Digging into the lives of Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and the like, reveals something inconceivably astounding. You realize as they question traditions and challenge the status quo, they may appear bold and self-assured on the surface. But when you peel back the layers, the truth is that they, too, grapple with fear, ambivalence, and self-doubt. We view them as self-starters, but their efforts are often fueled and sometimes forced by others. And as much as they seem to embrace conflict, they really prefer to avoid it.

Martin Luther King, Jr., the kingpin of the civil rights movement and who had a seismic impact on race relations in the United States, was apprehensive about joining the civil rights movement. He was nominated for the presidency of Montgomery Improvement Association - the organization that catapulted the Montgomery Bus Boycott and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to the forefront of the national struggle for civil rights - by another member. King later reflected, “It had happened so quickly that I did not even have time to think it through. It is probable that if I had, I would have declined the nomination”. Even later during the course of the revolution, King, and his wife wanted him to step down, however, he couldn't muster the courage to do so.

![Nelson Mandela](http://samyakchoudhary.com/img/nelson-mandela.jpg){: .center-image }

Nelson Mandela, the South African activist who played a key role in bringing an end to apartheid and was the leader of the anti-apartheid movement, was born into a high-ranking royal family and was raised to be a tribal leader. Oblivious of the discrimination faced by urban blacks, he would have dutifully followed the life path pre-decided for him had he not fled to Johannesburg in order to avoid an arranged marriage. As entering Johannesburg as an anonymous black person, he came to face-to-face with the brutal reality of racially divided South Africa. He had almost decided to go back to his village but was coaxed into attending a meeting of the African National Congress, an organization that aimed to establish a democratic government. Here Mandela presented the dichotomy between his life prior to coming to Johannesburg and his experiences there. Later, several militant young members of ANC persuaded him to form and lead the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) to enforce a more radical approach against racial discrimination. Though not being so keen about endeavoring into this, he relented after repeated requests.

And what about Mahatma Gandhi, the venerated freedom fighter who pioneered India's non-violent mass struggle for independence? [Gopal Krishna Gokhale’s repeated requests brought Mahatma Gandhi back to India](http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/et-commentary/gopal-krishna-gokhales-repeated-requests-brought-mahatma-gandhi-back-to-india/), from South Africa. He mentored Gandhi in his formative years and gave him a knowledge and understanding of India and the issues confronting common Indians. Studying the life of Gandhi further reveals how instances of self-doubt plagued the life of a man of insurmountable will. Self-doubt didn't leave him till his last breath and yet there has never been a revolutionary more celebrated than him!

**Rebels behind their public demeanor**

For rebels, there is not much to unveil since rebels don't believe in wearing any 'masks'. For them, flinching, even momentarily, from who they are is a sign of cowardice and rebels would prefer dying to coming across as a coward. No, they don't filter their thoughts, temper their strong emotions or cover their dissenting attitude. They don't hide their idiosyncracies either. They flout fickleness and call your shit, shit. 

![The Legend of Bhagat Singh, court](http://samyakchoudhary.com/img/the-legend-of-bhagat-singh-court.jpg){: .center-image }

Rebels are epitomes of courage and fearlessness. Not that they aren't afraid or insecure. However, they find common fears (such as death) ludicrous. Their biggest (and often only) fear is dying with their "mission" unaccomplished. This fear is the foundation of their ability to think on their feet and act spontaneously. Rebels are the first to stand against anyone or anything they consider "wrong" and while the common crowd will be consumed in gossip and the revolutionaries engrossed in anodyne discussions, rebels would already have acted. This doesn't mean that they don't plan. However, their plans have little to do with the feasibility of action and more to do with increasing probability of success.

[//]: <> (Anyway, enough of history. Let's talk movies!... I am omitting this section to reduce the length of this already humongous post. But, for those of you have nothing more interesting to do than read some supplementary content for this post - [Revolutionaries and Rebels in movies (and TV Shows)]().)

**Difference in Approach**

The core difference between a rebel and a revolutionary lies in the fact that while a rebel stands against something (e.g. colonization, apartheid, poverty, etc), a revolutionary stands for something (e.g. people's rights, equality, better livelihood). However, as any <adj> movement progresses forward, these distinctions blur in since, advocating for new systems often requires demolishing the old way of doing things and engaging in acts of creative destruction. 

When the demarcation between these two breeds of insurgents eventually becomes almost non-existent, how do we distinguish between them and most importantly why does it even matter?

Read [Revoluionaries vs Rebels (Part-2)](). In Part-2, I will discuss how the approaches adopted by revolutionaries and rebels differ on following grounds - 

- Target of Attack
- Earning Status vs Disregarding Status Quo
- Incremental Change vs Complete Overhaul
- Power of Idealism vs Power of Conscience
- Struggle of the masses vs Elitist Struggle

Then, provided the post doesn't become too long, I will cover Che Guevera, the 'Revolutionary Rebel', to cite an example where revolution becomes rebellion.

(Hopefully) after that, I will conclude.

See Ya.
