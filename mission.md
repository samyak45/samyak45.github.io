The free floaters of the world are happy to just go and do what they like, dismissing any talks of feasibility, external expectations, or being realistic (either becoming phenomenal or falling flat on their face; mostly the latter) . However, any pragmatic realizes that insolence for structure (financial, social, personal, or professional) is not only stupid but can also be catastrophic. I have always been a strong advocate of actively searching for and living your passions. But life is no fairytale where you wave a wand and get the life of your dreams. As you puff yourself up with aspirations and strive for them, it's essential to hedge your risks so that even if you fail and fall, you don't become crippled and can be back on your feet ASAP.
