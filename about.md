> “Follow the path of the unsafe, independent thinker. Expose your ideas to the dangers of controversy. Speak your mind and fear less the label of 'crack-pot' than the stigma of conformity. And on issues that seem important to you, stand up and be counted at any cost.”

X-men was my favorite cartoon series as a kid. I swooned over the mystic powers of the characters and fancied possessing them. Above all, I could relate to their atrocities. Not that I have professor Xavier's mind reading ability (actually I might), but because intellectual independence is a trait that is as daunting and marginalizing as mutants' evolutionary powers in a conformist majority.

Got my personal computer in grade 4 and instantly fell in love with it. Ever since that first encounter, I see technology as the key to evolution, a bridge to the future - something that can make us break free of all limitations and enter a brave new world.

Voracious reader and ardent knowledge seeker, spent my childhood devouring adventure novels and books on combinatorics, calculus, and electrodynamics.

Years of hard work and perseverance got me admission in India's leading technical institute, IIT Roorkee, with major in Computer Science, in 2013.

Eventually, Steve Jobs, Larry Page, and Elon Musk became real life heroes and I got smitten by the bug of entrepreneurship. I realized how entrepreneurship coupled with technology can have a massive impact on shaping the course of human history.

Utilized college to gain blend of technical acumen and leadership skills by participating in core projects, organizing events and leading teams.

Started personal blog to share thoughts and experiences along the path to acquiring knowledge as I keep exploring, questioning and searching to make this a more lively planet.
